# 🛡️ Pileus Fund

**The Pileus Fund** supports individuals working to preserve truth and freedom in the most dangerous places on Earth.

Journalists, protestors, and others operating in hostile environments can apply for emergency grants — but only if receiving funds through traditional infrastructure is impossible or life-threatening.

## 🔍 Accountability and Auditing

To ensure donor trust, the Fund will publish its full balance once per quarter:

- The entire balance will be transferred to a **viewable Monero account** for 24 hours.
- The **account address and private view key** will be posted publicly here.
- A detailed report of incoming donations and outgoing payments (with recipient details redacted) will also be published.
- After 24 hours, the balance returns to cold storage.

📅 **First audit**: July 1, 2025 (Fund launch)

> If the Fund must be closed, all assets will be donated equally to:
> - The Monero development team
> - The Tor Project
